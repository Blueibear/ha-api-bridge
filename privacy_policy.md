# Privacy Policy for Home Assistant API Bridge GPT

**Last updated:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

## 1. Introduction  
This Privacy Policy describes how the “Home Assistant API Bridge” ChatGPT plugin (“we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the plugin.

## 2. Information Collected  
- **API Key:** We do not store or transmit your Home Assistant API key. It is only used in-memory by your self-hosted proxy and never logged.  
- **User Queries:** Your natural-language requests are sent only to the plugin endpoint at `api.askrex.app` and not stored by us.

## 3. How We Use Information  
We use your API key solely to authenticate with your Home Assistant instance. Your queries and responses are processed on your Home Assistant server; we do not log or retain any personal data.

## 4. Data Sharing  
We do not share your API key or any personal data with third parties. All data remains between your client (ChatGPT) and your Home Assistant.

## 5. Security  
You control access via your own API key and Cloudflare Tunnel. We strongly recommend rotating your key periodically.
